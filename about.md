# About Me

I'm a passionate Python programmer and Linux enthusiast. With a strong background in software development and a love for open-source technologies, I enjoy exploring the vast possibilities that Python and Linux offer.

## Skills

- Python programming
- Linux administration
- Shell scripting
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Version control (Git)

## Experience

I have been working with Python for over 5 years, developing a wide range of applications and scripts. I am well-versed in building web applications using popular frameworks like Django and Flask. Additionally, I have experience in Linux server administration, managing deployments, and ensuring the security and performance of Linux-based systems.

## Interests

Apart from programming and Linux, I am also interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. I constantly strive to expand my knowledge and keep up with the latest trends and technologies in these fields.
